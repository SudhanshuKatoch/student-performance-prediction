# Student Performance Prediction ðŸŽ“ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting students' academic performance (e.g., final grades) using machine learning models. By analyzing factors such as attendance, study habits, and socio-economic factors, we aim to provide insights that can assist educators and institutions in improving student outcomes.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Understanding patterns and trends in student performance.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Testing multiple models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Visualizations:** Displaying correlations and insights for better interpretability.

## Installation
